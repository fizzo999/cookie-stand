### update 01/21/2021 -
I am building on my time management efforts from yesterday:
1.) 45min - read instructions thoroughly - construct entire input form
2.) 45min use input data to add JS constructor function;
3.) 2 hours - footer row delete last row of totals - get stuck - ask for help TAÂ  - big shout out to Sara and Steven

all in all 3.5 hours (it was going along really well until I got stuck trying to figure out why the bottom row would delete and then append but not delete again I kept getting multiple totals- finally got it fixed with 1 on 1 with Steven. Thank you)
